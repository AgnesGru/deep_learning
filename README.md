## Introduction

This project was created to improve my qualifications as a Python Developer. The main goal is to learn main Deep Learning concepts.
The internal code is written in Python. Basic Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries were used to create the model.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* python: 3.7.6
* TensorFlow: 2.1.0
* Keras:  2.3.1
* numpy: 1.19.3
* pandas: 1.1.4
* scikit-learn: 0.23.2
